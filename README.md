# SmartCalculator

##Implementation of SmartCalculator on C Language

This project realise the implementation of an extended version of the usual calculator, which can be found in the standard applications of each operating system in the C programming language using structured programming. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, there was supplemented the calculator with the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.). Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation. Besides calculating expressions, it also supportes the use of the _x_ variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.

    **Arithmetic operators**:

      | Operator name | Infix notation <br /> (Classic) | 
      | --------- | ------ |
      | Brackets | (a + b) |
      | Addition | a + b |
      | Subtraction | a - b |
      | Multiplication | a * b |
      | Division | a / b |
      | Power | a ^ b |
      | Modulus | a mod b |
      | Unary plus | +a |
      | Unary minus | -a |

    - **Functions**:
  
      | Function description | Function |
      | ------ | ------ |
      | Computes cosine | cos(x) |
      | Computes sine | sin(x) |
      | Computes tangent | tan(x) |
      | Computes arc cosine | acos(x) |
      | Computes arc sine | asin(x) |
      | Computes arc tangent | atan(x) |
      | Computes square root | sqrt(x) |
      | Computes natural logarithm | ln(x) |
      | Computes common logarithm | log(x) |


## Credit calculator

A special mode "credit calculator" provided:
- Input: total credit amount, term, interest rate, type (annuity, differentiated)
- Output: monthly payment, overpayment on credit, total payment


## Deposit calculator

A special mode "deposit profitability calculator" provided:
- Input: deposit amount, deposit term, interest rate, tax rate, periodicity of payments, capitalization of interest, replenishments list, partial withdrawals list
- Output: accrued interest, tax amount, deposit amount by the end of the term
